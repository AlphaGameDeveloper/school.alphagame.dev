# Build a Band

## Introduction

Ah, a new unit has appeared!  This time, we learned about sound, waves, 
wavelengths, and more!  To demonstrate our understanding, we built instruments
using bare-bones materials like pipes, wood, etc.  Optionally, we also made a
song about this unit called *"Frequency"*.  Trust me, you're gonna want to stick
around for this one!

## My Team

## The Project!

### Concepts

In this project, a lot of concepts were dumped in our brains *(as usual!)*,
Here's the most important ones:
* Lambda (&lambda; or *wavelength*)[[*](#lambda-note)] - The distance over which
a wave repeats.  e.g. crest to crest, trough to trough or any two points with a
distance of &lambda;.
* Crest - The *highest* point of a wave
* Trough - The *lowest* point of a wave
* Frequency (f) - The amount of waves per second Formula: *f = waves/seconds*
* Velocity (v) - Speed of energy transfer, usually in meters per second (squared?)
* Wave - Disturbance caused by energy movement through a medium (air, water, 
*virtually* anything really except a vacuum)
* Octave - A series of eight notes occupying the interval between two notes--One
having twice the frequency of the other.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave)

### What did we build?
We built... DRUM ROLL, PLEASE! An instrument!  Hold in your amazement, folks, 
for this is no ordinary intrument!  This is a DIY Chime built out of metal pipe,
wood, and twine.  Going once, going twice... shoot.  No takers?  Oh well, I'll
try again next year :)

In all seriousness, we made four individual instruments:
* Two Chimes (I was one of them)
* A Guitar[[*](#guitar-note)]
* A wind instrument *(i forgot the name)*

### The Song
As previously stated, we made a song about this unit.  The song is called
*"Frequency"*, and it is written to go along with the instrumental song [*"Intro"*
by The xx](https://open.spotify.com/track/5VfEuwErhx6X4eaPbyBfyu?si=d9eca5af9f9d491f).
I chose this song because it is instrumental, that is, it has no lyrics, and for
a while I wondered what the song would be like if it *had* lyrics.  I decided to
pick that up with this project because it was simple and we could possibly
(at least in theory) play it with our instruments.  Spoiler alert: We couldn't because I chickened out at the last moment because I thought it sounded bad (because it did suck a little).


### Project Retrospective

Now, I know that this project could have gone better.  As Piet Hein once said in
one of my favorite quotes of all time:
> The road to wisdom?  
Well it's plain  
And simple to express:  
Err and err  
and err again,  
but less and less and less.  
-- Piet Hein

**So what went wrong?**  I think it would be best to reflect on what *didn't* go
wrong.  This project had many cases where we could have royally screwed up, potentially costing us anything from one instrument all the way to screwing up the entire project.

One regret that I had is that we didn't play the song we wrote.  Even though it
kind of sucked, it would have been cool to play the song I spent so much time on.
